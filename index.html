          ABOUT US
        </h3>
        <h5 class="padding-none">
          We are a team of like-minded scientists whose aim 
          is to advance human civilization and better them. 
          Although humans have come a long way, we have stagnated.
          We wish to fix this and improve society. Our scientists 
          do research on humans and living creatures to compatibilitate 
          the genes of both species and discover new DNA. In other words,
          we wish to create meta-humans. Join us on this fascinating journey
          to progress our society forward!

          OUR HISTORY
        </h3>
        <h5 class="padding-none">
          Plankton Company was founded in 1995 by Dr. Plankton Singh, 
          our Head of Research Faculty. He had suffered an unfortunate loss 
          which gave him the idea to create Plankton Company so that society no longer had to grieve as he did.
          <br> Since then, we have hired many talented scientists who have greatly contributed to our research and development. 
          Plankton Company hopes to recruit more people to play a part in moving forward in the near future. 
          <br>We are currently undertaking the BIO-TECH-413 Human Experiment Project (BTHEP) and have made
          many new discoveries thanks to our co-operative participants.

        <h5 class="padding-none">
          Asteroids have varying types, masses, sizes, and shapes. 
          Because of their different masses, they can fly towards the planet as different speeds. 
          There are <a href="./asteroids">different types of asteroids</a> of different difficulties. 
          Some asteroids has a turret attached to it, aiming at the player's <a href="./sfo">SFO</a>. 
          If the spaceship gets hit, it will get stunned! 
          The amount of lives deducted from planets depends on the type of asteroid that hit its surface.
